  //A Map is an Iterable consisting of pairs of keys and values (also named mappings or associations). 
  // Scala’s Predef object offers an implicit conversion that lets you write 
  // key -> value as an alternate syntax for the pair (key, value). 
  // For instance Map("x" -> 24, "y" -> 25, "z" -> 26) means exactly the same as 
  // Map(("x", 24), ("y", 25), ("z", 26)), but reads better.
  
  //The fundamental operations on maps are similar to those on sets. 
  // They are summarized in the following table and fall into the following categories:
  
  // - Lookup operations apply, get, getOrElse, contains, and isDefinedAt. 
  // hese turn maps into partial functions from keys to values. The fundamental lookup method for a map is: 
  // def get(key): Option[Value]. The operation m.get(key) tests whether the map contains an association 
  // for the given key. If so, it returns the associated value in a Some. 
  // If no key is defined in the map, get returns None. 
  // Maps also define an apply method that returns the value associated with a given key directly, 
  // without wrapping it in an Option. If the key is not defined in the map, an exception is raised.
  
  // - Additions and updates +, ++, updated, which let you add new bindings to a map or change existing bindings.
  
  // - Removals -, --, which remove bindings from a map.
  
  // - Subcollection producers keys, keySet, keysIterator, values, valuesIterator, 
  // which return a map’s keys and values separately in various forms.
  
  // - Transformations filterKeys and mapValues, which produce a new map by filtering and transforming bindings 
  // of an existing map.
